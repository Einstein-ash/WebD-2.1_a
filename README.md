# EMR's Club Website Project - Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the EMR's Club Website Project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. To ensure consistency and maintain a high standard of code quality, we have established some guidelines that all contributors should follow. Please read the following guidelines carefully before making any contributions.

## General Contribution Guidelines

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main repository to your GitHub account.
    
2.  **Branching:** Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix. This helps to keep the main branch clean and allows for easier review and merging of changes.
    
3.  **Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Your commit message should summarize the changes you have made.
    
4.  **Pull Requests:** When you are ready to submit your changes, open a pull request. Ensure that your pull request includes a detailed description of the changes made, along with any relevant information for the reviewers.
    
5.  **Code Reviews:** All pull requests will undergo a code review. Be open to feedback and address any comments or concerns raised by the reviewers. This iterative process helps maintain code quality and consistency.
    
6.  **Testing:** Whenever applicable, include tests for your code changes. Tests help ensure that your code behaves as expected and guards against regressions.
    
7.  **Documentation:** Update the project documentation whenever you make significant changes. This includes updating README files, adding inline code comments, and providing any necessary user documentation.
    
8.  **Respectful and Inclusive Environment:** We strive to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors. Be considerate and professional in your interactions with others. We encourage diversity and welcome contributions from everyone.
    

## Coding Style Guidelines

1.  **Naming Conventions:**
    
    -   Variables and Functions: Use CamelCase for variable and function names. For example: `firstName`, `getUserData()`.
    -   Filenames: Use PascalCase for file names. For example: `MyFile.js`, `ApiService.php`.
2.  **Indentation and Whitespace:**
    
    -   Use spaces for indentation. Indentation size should be 2 spaces.
    -   Avoid trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
    -   Maintain consistent and logical use of whitespace within code blocks to improve readability.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### ` npm install --legacy-peer-deps ` or ` npm install --force `

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dev`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

If you want to intall something - Then append  ` --legacy-peer-deps ` to that command 


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
